**Modeling the Ancient Valley of Mexico's Lake System at Varying Water Levels**

This project provides an interactive geospatial visualization of the ancient lake that once covered the Valley of Mexico. Based on digital elevation data from USGS EarthExplorer and using modern web mapping tools, it allows users to simulate water coverage at different altitudes and analyze the emergence of islands and proximity to ancient settlements.

## Project Motivation

This tool was developed as part of a research project exploring the symbolic, historical, and cosmological foundations of **Tenochtitlan** and the Mexica migration from **Aztlan**. It supports the hypothesis that geographical transformations over centuries aligned with the myth of **Huitzilopochtli's birth** and the founding of the sacred city.

The work is described in detail in the academic paper:  
[Geospatial and Symbolic Hypothesis for the Foundation of Tenochtitlan (arXiv preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX) ← *will be replaced with link*

## Features

- Visualizes ancient lake coverage in the Valley of Mexico at customizable elevation levels.
- Marks key archaeological and historical sites (e.g., Tenochtitlan, Cuicuilco, Aztahuacan).
- Includes geodetic alignment overlays (e.g., Tenayuca–Tlatelolco–Templo Mayor–Cerro de la Estrella).
- Supports symbolic interpretation of sites tied to Mexica cosmology.
